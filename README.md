Node: v18.11.0

Steps to start project:

1. `yarn`
2. `yarn start`
3. Go to localhost:3000

Notes for reviewers:

- I wasn't focusing on the looks of the UI, it's mostly there just to test app functionality
- Promise wrappers for localStorage - totally unnecessary, but I wanted app look similar to regular apps with api calls
